## 5. Technical Implementation Details

### 5.1 AI/ML Components

```python
# Example: Intent Recognition System
def process_user_input(self, user_input: str) -> str:
    user_input_lower = user_input.lower()
    
    if self._is_trending_songs_request(user_input_lower):
        return self._handle_trending_songs_request(user_input)
    elif self._is_artist_info_request(user_input_lower):
        return self._handle_artist_info_request(user_input)
    # ... more intent handlers
```

### 5.2 API Integration Strategy

- **Primary Data Sources**: Spotify API, Genius API
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Mock data for offline functionality
